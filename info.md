# Detailed Development Log — [Today]

## 1. Initial Error Fixes

### ErrorProvider Import/Export Issue
- **Problem:** The app was importing `ErrorProvider` from `errors.jsx`, but this was not exported, causing a runtime error and a black screen (500 error page shown by the error boundary).
- **Fix:** Removed all references to `ErrorProvider` in `App.jsx`. Now, only `ErrorBoundary` is used for error handling, matching the actual exports in `errors.jsx`.
- **Result:** The app loads correctly, and error boundaries work as intended.

### General Import/Export Hygiene
- Verified that all imports in `App.jsx` and `errors.jsx` match the actual exports.
- Ensured that all error page components are properly exported and imported where needed.

## 2. Error Page Improvements

### Custom Error Pages
- **Pages improved:** 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), 503 (Service Unavailable), 401 (Unauthorized), 502 (Bad Gateway), 504 (Gateway Timeout), and a generic error page.
- **Design:** Each page uses a unique, branded, and responsive design consistent with the Overlays site theme. All pages use Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsiveness and accessibility.
- **SVGs and Animations:** Custom SVG backgrounds and subtle animations are used for visual polish.

### Error Page Routing & Testing
- **Test Routes Added:**
  - `/error/403` → 403 page
  - `/error/404` → 404 page
  - `/error/500` → 500 page
  - `/error/503` → 503 page
  - `/error/401` → 401 page
  - `/error/502` → 502 page
  - `/error/504` → 504 page
- **Catch-all Route:** Any unknown route (`*`) shows the 404 page.
- **Testing Instructions:** Provided clear instructions for QA to visit each error route and verify design and responsiveness.
- **Cleanup:** After testing, recommended removing the explicit `/error/xxx` routes to prevent public access, keeping only the catch-all 404 and real error logic.

### Responsiveness & Accessibility
- All error pages are fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- All interactive elements (buttons, links) are large, touch-friendly, and accessible.
- SVG backgrounds are visually hidden from screen readers for accessibility.

## 3. Mobile Menu (FloatingCardMenu) UI/UX Improvements

### Backdrop Blur/Overlay
- **Problem:** The mobile menu overlay was too dark/blue, making the background content hard to see.
- **Fix:** Reduced the overlay to `bg-black/10 backdrop-blur-sm` for a lighter, more subtle effect.
- **Result:** Background content is now visible when the menu is open, improving the user experience.

### Menu Close on Scroll
- **Problem:** When "Shop by Category" was clicked, the menu did not close, leaving the overlay visible.
- **Fix:** Updated the click handler so that after scrolling to the collection grid, the menu closes and the overlay is removed.
- **Result:** The menu now closes as soon as the scroll is triggered, and the background is visible.

### Contact Item Highlight Bug
- **Problem:** The "Contact" menu item appeared selected/highlighted by default, even though it was not a link.
- **Fix:** Only apply the hover/active background to menu items that are actual links (`href` present). The Contact item now appears neutral.
- **Result:** No more unwanted highlight on Contact; only links get the background on hover/tap.

## 4. New Features & Pages
- **Error page test routes** were added for QA (see above).
- **No new main pages** were added today, but all error pages and the mobile menu were improved and tested.
- 2024-06-09: Removed the click-to-expand (enlarge) effect for all cards in the CollectionGrid section. Now, clicking any card does nothing on all screen sizes, as per user request.

## 5. Testing & QA
- **Manual QA:**
  - Visited all error test routes on mobile and desktop to verify design, responsiveness, and accessibility.
  - Tested the mobile menu overlay, menu close behavior, and Contact item highlight on various devices.
- **Instructions Provided:**
  - How to test each error page.
  - How to remove test routes after QA.
- **Results:**
  - All error pages render correctly and are visually consistent.
  - Mobile menu works as expected, with improved overlay and correct item highlighting.

## 6. Summary of All Changes
- Fixed critical import/export and error boundary issues.
- Improved and tested all error pages for design, responsiveness, and accessibility.
- Enhanced mobile menu overlay and interaction for a better user experience.
- Provided clear QA/testing instructions and cleanup steps.
