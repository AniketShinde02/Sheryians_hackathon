## 📝 About This Build
This project is a reimagined version of an overlays clothing e-commerce site, built from scratch and iteratively improved with the help of mentors and AI. The goal was to create a smooth, beautiful, and technically robust site that stands out in both design and performance. Every section, from the hero to the product grid, was crafted with attention to detail and responsiveness. The site leverages the power of Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and Vite for fast development and builds.
